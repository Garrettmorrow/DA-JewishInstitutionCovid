# New York Times API Scraping Python Code
## How the media viewed Jewish institutions' responses to COVID-19
This is a repository of web scraping code/data regarding media perceptions of Jewish institutional responses to COVID.

I used the New York Times' API article search to scrape all of the stories regarding Jewish institutional responses to COVID. I used the keywords: Jewish, Minyan, institution, and COVID in various combinations to construct the search.

See the Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) for the code.
See the Output folder for the .csv outputs.
